Ride css
========

Stylus mixin library for a faster frontend development. This could be a good alternative to more famous buildable css libraries.

Why walk when you can Ride?

##Installing ride
Ride **requires** Stylus.js and (obviously) node.js installed

> [Install node.js](http://nodejs.org/ "Click here to go to node.js website")

> Install stylus.js. Type ```npm install -g stylus``` in your terminal and you've done.

> Install nib (recommended for css3 agnostic deveolpment). Type ```npm install -g nib``` in your terminal and you've done.

> download Ride css and unzip into your working folder (eg: workspace/), include ride in your buildable "*.styl" file and you have done.
