#css normalize

*Original version by Nicolas Gallagher and Jonathan Neal can be found here https://github.com/necolas/normalize.css/*

This mixin will return a css normalization. Usually it's the best way to make different browser's rendering the same.

It's **highly recommended** if you are planning to develop your css for **IE9+** or for **mobile devices**.

Basic usage

```sass
  css-normalize()
  //or
  &
    reset-type: 'normalize'
```
